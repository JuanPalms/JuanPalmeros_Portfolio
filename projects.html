                website. It automates clicks to extract a random poem and then sends
                it via email. Additionally, an image is attached to the email, which
                is sent to a list of addresses specified by the user in the
                `logging_keys.yaml` configuration file. The project is developed in
                Python and utilizes the Selenium, smtplib, and yaml libraries.

                This project is a comprehensive data science implementation that
                spans from data extraction through web scraping of the MyAnimeList
                site to metric visualization on a Streamlit dashboard hosted on AWS
                EC2. Furthermore, a second phase is presented, which encompasses an
                in-depth analysis and the deployment of a web page based on Quarto.
                The entire workflow, from data acquisition to visual representation,
                is detailed in linked repositories, ensuring replicability and
                transparency.

              <h2>Hierarchical prediction: Radon</h2>
              <p>
              This project delves deep into Bayesian Modeling using the PyStan
              library, emphasizing its ability to predict outcomes by recognizing
              and navigating both natural and social hierarchies that permeate
              specific structures. Drawing on data from Uranium and Radon
              measurements, the research facilitates preprocessing and
              comprehensive exploratory analysis. Hierarchical models are then
              employed to precisely estimate Radon levels in homes. These models
              are rigorously tested and benchmarked within specialized notebooks.

                <h2>Deforestation image classiffier</h2>
                <p>
                  This project was designed to identify different types of
                  deforestation from a collection of images. Utilizing satellite
                  captures of deforestation areas, a multi-class classification
                  approach was implemented to distinguish various deforestation
              phenomena, such as commercial plantations that degrade the presence
              of local trees. By employing artificial intelligence tools and
              algorithms, early identification of deforested zones was made
              possible, allowing the development of easily accessible solutions to
              mitigate this global problem. The data set included 1512 training
              images and 635 test images, along with accompanying latitude,
              longitude, and labels.

                <p>
                  This project provides a comprehensive machine learning pipeline for
                  predicting house prices in England. Developed with an emphasis on
                  best coding practices, it champions modularity, ensuring each step
                  of the process is clear and maintainable. By leveraging Python
                  libraries like sklearn and pickle, it facilitates efficient data
                  preprocessing, rigorous model training, and accurate predictions.
                  Additionally, with dedicated scripts for training and prediction,
                  the setup elegantly embodies the essence of a streamlined and
                  replicable machine learning workflow.
