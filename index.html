        <p>
          👋🏻 Hi, I'm Juan Francisco Palmeros Barradas! I'm a Data Scientist
          based in Mexico City working in the banking industry and with proven
          experiences in the public policy sector.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hold a Master's degree in Data Science from the Autonomous
          Technological Institute of Mexico (ITAM) and a Bachelor's degree in
          Economics from the Center for Research and Teaching in Economics
          (CIDE).
        </p>
        <p>
          I see huge potential for the application of Data Science across
          various industries, in particular in the banking and fintech sectors.
          Since I was an economics student, I have been passionate about
          financial inclusion and the use of data to improve the lives of
          people. 🏋🏻 When I'm not working, I enjoy indulging in various hobbies.
          I love learning new techniques and tools in the field of Data Science
          (I'm a long-life online learner). I also enjoy having a walk with my
          dog, wathcing anime and cooking.
        </p>
